### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### **`api/`**

- **Purpose:** Handles all API-related functionalities, exposing endpoints for client interactions and managing data flow between the backend and frontend or external services. It ensures consistent data representation and encapsulates logic related to HTTP requests and responses.
    - **`serializers/`**: Handles data transformation into API-compatible formats, specifically handling edge cases or custom serialization needs for specific entities.
        - Examples:
            - `UserSerializer.php`: Converts user objects to JSON for external communication.
            - `ProductSerializer.php`: Serializes complex product entities, including nested attributes.
            - `OrderSerializer.php`: Transforms order objects into client-facing representations.
            - `CategorySerializer.php`: Serializes hierarchical category structures.
            - `PaymentSerializer.php`: Formats payment details into a clean, usable JSON.
            - `NotificationSerializer.php`: Converts notification entities for API responses.
            - `ProfileSerializer.php`: Handles serialization of detailed user profiles.
            - `ReportSerializer.php`: Converts report data into API-compatible formats.
            - `ReviewSerializer.php`: Serializes review objects for frontend use.
            - `DiscountSerializer.php`: Handles serialization of discounts or promotional codes.

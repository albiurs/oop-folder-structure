### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### **`api/`**

- **Purpose:** Handles all API-related functionalities, exposing endpoints for client interactions and managing data flow between the backend and frontend or external services. It ensures consistent data representation and encapsulates logic related to HTTP requests and responses.
    - **`controllers/`**: These files process HTTP requests, call relevant services, and return appropriate responses (e.g., JSON or HTTP status codes). Controllers act as the interface between external requests and internal logic.
        - Examples:
            - `UserController.php`: Processes requests like registering users, fetching user data, or updating profiles.
            - `OrderController.php`: Handles endpoints like placing an order, viewing order history, or canceling an order.
            - `AuthController.php`: Manages authentication, including login, logout, and token refresh.
            - `ProductController.php`: Handles product-related CRUD operations like adding, updating, or deleting products.
            - `PaymentController.php`: Processes requests for initiating or validating payments.
            - `CategoryController.php`: Manages endpoints for retrieving or modifying product categories.
            - `ProfileController.php`: Handles user profile updates or preferences.
            - `NotificationController.php`: Manages sending or retrieving notifications for users.
            - `ReportController.php`: Exposes endpoints to generate and download reports.
            - `ReviewController.php`: Handles product review creation, updates, and retrieval.
    - **`resources/`**: Defines how data is structured and presented in API responses. These classes ensure that the output returned to the client is consistent, human-readable, and well-organized.
        - Examples:
            - `UserResource.php`: Formats user data, such as `id`, `name`, and `email`, in a structured way.
            - `OrderResource.php`: Formats order information, including items, totals, and status.
            - `ProductResource.php`: Structures product details for clients, including `name`, `price`, and availability.
            - `ErrorResource.php`: Standardizes error messages with details like error codes and descriptions.
            - `CategoryResource.php`: Structures data for product categories.
            - `PaymentResource.php`: Formats details about completed or pending payments.
            - `NotificationResource.php`: Structures notifications for API responses.
            - `ProfileResource.php`: Presents user profile data for frontend applications.
            - `ReportResource.php`: Structures report data, including titles, stats, and download links.
            - `ReviewResource.php`: Formats product reviews for users.
    - **`serializers/`**: Handles data transformation into API-compatible formats, specifically handling edge cases or custom serialization needs for specific entities.
        - Examples:
            - `UserSerializer.php`: Converts user objects to JSON for external communication.
            - `ProductSerializer.php`: Serializes complex product entities, including nested attributes.
            - `OrderSerializer.php`: Transforms order objects into client-facing representations.
            - `CategorySerializer.php`: Serializes hierarchical category structures.
            - `PaymentSerializer.php`: Formats payment details into a clean, usable JSON.
            - `NotificationSerializer.php`: Converts notification entities for API responses.
            - `ProfileSerializer.php`: Handles serialization of detailed user profiles.
            - `ReportSerializer.php`: Converts report data into API-compatible formats.
            - `ReviewSerializer.php`: Serializes review objects for frontend use.
            - `DiscountSerializer.php`: Handles serialization of discounts or promotional codes.

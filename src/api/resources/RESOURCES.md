### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### `api/`

- **Purpose:** Handles all API-related functionalities, exposing endpoints for client interactions and managing data flow between the backend and frontend or external services. It ensures consistent data representation and encapsulates logic related to HTTP requests and responses.

    - `resources/`: Defines how data is structured and presented in API responses. These classes ensure that the output returned to the client is consistent, human-readable, and well-organized.
        - Examples:
            - `user_resource.py`: Formats user data, such as `id`, `name`, and `email`, in a structured way.
            - `order_resource.py`: Formats order information, including items, totals, and status.
            - `product_resource.py`: Structures product details for clients, including `name`, `price`, and availability.
            - `error_resource.py`: Standardizes error messages with details like error codes and descriptions.
            - `category_resource.py`: Structures data for product categories.
            - `payment_resource.py`: Formats details about completed or pending payments.
            - `notification_resource.py`: Structures notifications for API responses.
            - `profile_resource.py`: Presents user profile data for frontend applications.
            - `report_resource.py`: Structures report data, including titles, stats, and download links.
            - `review_resource.py`: Formats product reviews for users.

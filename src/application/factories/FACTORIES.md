### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### `application/`

- **Purpose:** Implements the main workflows and use cases of the application. This folder bridges domain logic with external systems and user actions, encapsulating high-level business logic.
    - `factories/`: Responsible for creating and configuring objects, abstracting away complex initialization logic, especially when multiple dependencies are involved.
        - Examples:
            - `user_factory.py`: Creates user objects with default or custom configurations.
            - `order_factory.py`: Generates order instances for testing or production use.
            - `product_factory.py`: Builds product objects with sample or specified data.
            - `category_factory.py`: Creates category instances for use in the application.
            - `payment_factory.py`: Builds payment objects with default configurations.
            - `notification_factory.py`: Generates notification objects for various use cases.
            - `profile_factory.py`: Constructs user profile objects with mock or real data.
            - `discount_factory.py`: Creates discount codes or coupon objects.
            - `review_factory.py`: Builds review objects for products or services.
            - `report_factory.py`: Prepares report objects for analysis or output.

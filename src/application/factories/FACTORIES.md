### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### **`application/`**

- **Purpose:** Implements the main workflows and use cases of the application. This folder bridges domain logic with external systems and user actions, encapsulating high-level business logic.
    - **`factories/`**: Responsible for creating and configuring objects, abstracting away complex initialization logic, especially when multiple dependencies are involved.
        - Examples:
            - `UserFactory.php`: Creates user objects with default or custom configurations.
            - `OrderFactory.php`: Generates order instances for testing or production use.
            - `ProductFactory.php`: Builds product objects with sample or specified data.
            - `CategoryFactory.php`: Creates category instances for use in the application.
            - `PaymentFactory.php`: Builds payment objects with default configurations.
            - `NotificationFactory.php`: Generates notification objects for various use cases.
            - `ProfileFactory.php`: Constructs user profile objects with mock or real data.
            - `DiscountFactory.php`: Creates discount codes or coupon objects.
            - `ReviewFactory.php`: Builds review objects for products or services.
            - `ReportFactory.php`: Prepares report objects for analysis or output.

### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### **`shared/`**

- **Purpose:** The `shared` folder is a central location for **reusable, cross-cutting utilities, components, and resources** that are used across multiple parts of the application. This folder helps promote code reuse, maintainability, and consistency by consolidating shared functionality. Common examples include helper functions, constants, configuration files, and adapters for external integrations. Hence, the folder is for cross-cutting concerns like **shared domain logic**, **constants**, or **DTOs** that **don’t neatly fit elsewhere**. This **avoids duplication** across the project.
    - **`dto/`**: The **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** folder in the `shared/` directory is used to define reusable objects for transferring structured data between layers or components of the application. DTOs are often simple objects or classes that only contain properties and no business logic. They help: 1.  **Decouple Layers**: They provide a clean way to transfer data between the domain, application, infrastructure, or presentation layers without exposing internal implementation details. 2.  **Validation**: DTOs can enforce strict typing and validation to ensure only expected data is passed. 3.  **Reusability**: Common DTOs can be shared across modules, avoiding duplication. 4.  **Consistency**: Standardized data structures ensure consistent communication across application layers.
        - Examples:
            - `user_dto.py`: Represents user-related data for transfer between application and infrastructure layers.
            - `order_dto.py`: Represents order details for communication between services.
            - `pagination_dto.py`: Defines data structure for paginated API responses.
            - `auth_response_dto.py`: Represents authentication response data, e.g., tokens and expiration.
            - `product_dto.py`: Encapsulates product data for catalog or inventory systems.
            - `error_response_dto.py`: Represents standardized error responses for APIs or services.
            - `payment_dto.py`: Represents payment-related data for use in payment processing systems.
            - `address_dto.py`: Represents address data for shipping or billing.
            - `notification_dto.py`: Represents a notification object for sending alerts/messages.
            - `file_upload_dto.py`: Represents metadata for file uploads.

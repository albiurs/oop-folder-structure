### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

#### **`shared/`**

- **Purpose:** The `shared` folder is a central location for **reusable, cross-cutting utilities, components, and resources** that are used across multiple parts of the application. This folder helps promote code reuse, maintainability, and consistency by consolidating shared functionality. Common examples include helper functions, constants, configuration files, and adapters for external integrations. Hence, the folder is for cross-cutting concerns like **shared domain logic**, **constants**, or **DTOs** that **don’t neatly fit elsewhere**. This **avoids duplication** across the project.
    - **`helpers/`**: Contains utility functions or modules that provide commonly used functionality across the application.
        - Examples:
            - `date_utils.py`: Functions for handling date and time formatting.
            - `string_utils.py`: Functions for string manipulation (e.g., slug generation).
            - `math_utils.py`: Functions for calculations and numeric processing.

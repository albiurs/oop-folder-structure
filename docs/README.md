This folder structure demonstrates a well-organized and modular approach to organizing an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project.

### **Purpose**

1.  **Clear Separation of Concerns**:

    - The structure cleanly separates different layers of the application (e.g., `api`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `application`). Each layer has a clear purpose, which aligns with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
    - Specific folders like `services`, `repositories`, and `value_objects` suggest a thoughtful adherence to SOLID principles.
2.  **Scalability**:

    - By breaking down components into subfolders (`controllers`, `serializers`, etc.), the structure is built to scale for larger projects without becoming chaotic.
    - The `use_cases` folder is particularly useful for isolating application-specific workflows, which can simplify maintenance.
3.  **Domain-Focused**:

    - The `domain` folder emphasizes business logic and ensures it remains decoupled from technical infrastructure. This is a core principle of DDD, making the application logic easier to test and evolve.
4.  **Attention to Asynchronous Processes**:

    - The inclusion of a `jobs/` folder for background tasks shows consideration for asynchronous workflows, which are common in modern applications.
5.  **Modular API Design**:

    - Splitting API components (`controllers`, `resources`, `serializers`) promotes modularity and reusability.
    - This structure aligns well with RESTful API design principles or can be adapted for GraphQL or other patterns.
6.  **Infrastructure Layer**:

    - Having a dedicated `infrastructure/` folder for external system interaction, caching, and middleware ensures technical concerns are isolated from the core domain logic.
    - Adapters make the codebase flexible for integrating third-party systems.
7.  **Testing and Utilities**:

    - `tests/` is included in `src/`, encouraging developers to keep tests close to the implementation, which can simplify navigation and reduce friction for writing tests.
    - A `utilities/` folder provides a home for reusable helper functions, keeping the rest of the codebase clean.

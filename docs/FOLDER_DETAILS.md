        - Example: `guzzlehttp/guzzle/Client.php` (to send HTTP requests).
    7.  **`phpunit/`**: Test framework library files.
        - Example: `phpunit/phpunit/Framework/TestCase.php` (base class for test cases).
    8.  **`monolog/`**: For advanced logging solutions.
        - Example: `monolog/monolog/Logger.php` (logging utility).
    9.  **`doctrine/`**: Provides database-related libraries (e.g., ORM, migrations).
        - Example: `doctrine/orm/EntityManager.php` (ORM database manager).
    10. **`fakerphp/`**: Library for generating fake data (useful for tests or seeding databases).
        - Example: `fakerphp/faker/src/Faker/Generator.php`.

- **Examples of contents in an npm (Node.js)-managed `vendor/` folder:**
    1.  `node_modules/`: Main subfolder where dependencies are stored.

    - **`dto/`**: The **DTO (Data Transfer Object)** folder in the `shared/` directory is used to define reusable objects for transferring structured data between layers or components of the application. DTOs are often simple objects or classes that only contain properties and no business logic. They help: 1.  **Decouple Layers**: They provide a clean way to transfer data between the domain, application, infrastructure, or presentation layers without exposing internal implementation details. 2.  **Validation**: DTOs can enforce strict typing and validation to ensure only expected data is passed. 3.  **Reusability**: Common DTOs can be shared across modules, avoiding duplication. 4.  **Consistency**: Standardized data structures ensure consistent communication across application layers.

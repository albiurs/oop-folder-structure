### **Folder Structure Explanation**

* * *

### **`vendor/`**

- **Purpose:** Contains **third-party libraries** and dependencies managed by package managers such as `pip`. This folder is typically auto-generated and should not be edited directly. It ensures that external libraries are integrated and kept up-to-date with your project.
  > **Important Note:** The `vendor/` folder (or its equivalent in Python, typically `site-packages/` within the virtual environment) is excluded from version control (e.g., in `.gitignore`) as it is auto-generated.
    - **Examples of contents in a typical Python `vendor/` or `site-packages/` folder:**
        1.  `requests/`: HTTP library for making API calls.
            - Example: `requests/models.py` (defines HTTP request/response classes).
        2.  `flask/`: Lightweight web application framework.
            - Example: `flask/app.py` (main application logic for Flask).
        3.  `sqlalchemy/`: ORM library for database interactions.
            - Example: `sqlalchemy/orm/session.py` (manages database sessions).
        4.  `pytest/`: Testing framework for Python.
            - Example: `pytest/main.py` (entry point for running tests).
        5.  `pydantic/`: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
            - Example: `pydantic/main.py` (base class for creating data models).
        6.  `celery/`: Asynchronous task queue/job queue system.
            - Example: `celery/app/task.py` (defines task-related logic).
        7.  `numpy/`: Library for numerical computations.
            - Example: `numpy/core/_methods.py` (core mathematical methods).
        8.  `matplotlib/`: Library for data visualization.
            - Example: `matplotlib/pyplot.py` (interface for creating plots).
        9.  `scikit-learn/`: Machine learning library.
            - Example: `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` (tools for cross-validation and data splitting).
        10. `django/`: Full-stack web framework for building web applications.
            - Example: `django/db/models/query.py` (database query logic).
        - **Common auto-generated files in the virtual environment:**
            1.  **`pip.conf`**: Configuration file for `pip`, specifying repository URLs or caching options.
            2.  **`python_version.txt`**: Tracks the Python version used by the environment.
            3.  **`pyvenv.cfg`**: Configuration file for the Python virtual environment.
        - **Note on Dependency Management Tools:**
            - **Pipfile.lock**: Tracks exact versions of installed libraries when using `pipenv`.
            - **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies and their versions for replication.
        - - **Dependency Management Tools:**
            1.  **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all project dependencies with pinned versions.
                - Example: `requests==2.28.1`, `flask==2.2.2`.
            2.  **`Pipfile.lock`**: Lock file generated by `pipenv` to ensure consistent library versions across environments.
            3.  **`pyproject.toml`**: A modern configuration file for `poetry` or other build tools.
                - Example:
        ```
        [tool.poetry.dependencies]
        requests = "^2.28.1"
        flask = "^2.2.2"			
        ```
